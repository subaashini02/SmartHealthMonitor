Health Tracking App
Problem Statement
Malaysia is experiencing a steady rise in non-communicable diseases (NCDs) such as diabetes, hypertension, and heart disease. These conditions are often linked to unhealthy lifestyles, poor diets, and lack of regular exercise. Although healthier living habits and consistent health monitoring can help manage or prevent these diseases, many Malaysians struggle with busy lifestyles, lack of awareness, and inadequate access to health services.

Our mobile app aims to address this issue by serving as a personal health assistant. It allows users to track their health metrics easily and encourages preventive health care. By integrating tools like step counting, water intake logs, and health reminders, our app empowers individuals to take control of their well-being. Additionally, the app provides educational content on healthy living, helping cultivate healthier habits that reduce the risk of NCDs.
